* DESCRIPTION:
*   This file is part of the interface (glue layer) between an Embedded Wizard
*   generated UI application and the board support package (BSP) of a dedicated
*   target.
*   This template is responsible to initialize the display hardware of the board
*   and to provide the necessary access to update the display content.
*   The color format of the framebuffer has to correspond to the color format
*   of the Graphics Engine.
*
*   Important: This file is intended to be used as a template. Please adapt the
*   implementation according your particular hardware.

* TYPE:
*   XDisplayInfo
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The structure XDisplayInfo describes the attributes and current configuration
*   of the display. The interpretation and usage of the members may depend on the
*   underlying system and the selected framebuffer integration scenario.
*
* ELEMENTS:
*   FrameBuffer    - Pointer to the framebuffer memory. In case of double-buffering
*     it refers to the first framebuffer (not the currently active front-buffer).
*     If the display is updated from a scrach-pad buffer, the pointer refers to
*     the scratch-pad buffer memory.
*   DoubleBuffer   - Pointer to the second framebuffer in case of double-buffering.
*     If the display is updated from a scrach-pad buffer, the pointer refers to
*     the second scratch-pad buffer memory in case of double-buffering.
*   BufferWidth,
*   BufferHeight   - Size of the framebuffer(s) / scratch-pad buffer(s) in pixel.
*   DisplayWidth,
*   DisplayHeight  - Size of the display in pixel.
*   UpdateMode     - The display update mode (normal, partial, scratch-pad).
*   Context        - Optional pointer to a target specific struct.

*   that the rendering of the next frame can start.
*   In case of a double-buffering system, the function has to wait until the
*   V-sync has occured and the pending buffer is used by the display controller.
*   In case of an external display controller, the function has to wait until
*   the transfer (update) of the graphics data has been completed and there are

*
* DESCRIPTION:
*   The function EwBspDisplayCommitBuffer is called from the Graphics Engine

*   The type of buffer depends on the selected framebuffer concept.
*   If the display is running in a double-buffering mode, the function is called
*   after each buffer update in order to change the currently active framebuffer
*   address. Changing the framebuffer address should be synchronized with V-sync.
*   If the system is using an external graphics controller, this function is
*   responsible to start the transfer of the framebuffer content.

*   aX,
*   aY       - Origin of the area which has been updated by the Graphics Engine.
