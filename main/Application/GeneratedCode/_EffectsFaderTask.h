   preceding @OnStart() method.

   default implementation of the method simply cancels the task causing the next 
   available task in the task queue to be started. You should override this method 
   in derived task classes to implement what the task should do.
   There are three typical application cases how to implement the OnStart() method:
   - In its simplest case the entire task algorithm is implemented in the OnStart() 
   method. In this case the method @Complete() should be called before leaving OnStart().
   - If the task does take long time for execution by using timers or effects, you 
   should put in OnStart() the code necessary to start the timers/effects. Don't 
   forget to call @Complete() when all timers/effects are done.
   - If the task is divided in many small execution steps, the OnStart() method 
   should call @Continue() to request the @OnContinue() method to be executed after 
   a short delay (usually after the next screen update). In @OnContinue() you can 
   perform the next step of the task. If necessary, @OnContinue() can also request 
   to be called again after a short delay. At the end of the task, after the last 
   step is terminated, don't forget to call @Complete().
   The parameter aQueue refers to the queue this task belongs to. It can be used 
   to schedule more task to execute later. */

/* The method Complete() informs the task queue about the completion of this task. 
   Thereupon the next available task in the queue can be executed. This method is

   task has finalized its work. Calling the method for a not current task has no 
   effect. */
