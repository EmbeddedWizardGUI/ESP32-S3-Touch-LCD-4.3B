/* The class Core::KeyPressHandler provides a universal keyboard event handler able 
   to process key press and release events. It compares the received key codes with 
   the value of the property @Filter and if the codes do match the filter condition, 
   sends signals to the slot methods stored in the @OnPress, @OnHold and @OnRelease 
   properties.
   Keyboard handlers can be created at the design time only. You can simply drag-and-drop 
   them from the Embedded Wizard Gallery into the Composer window where you are 
   editing the GUI component. If necessary several keyboard handlers can be added 
   to the component. For example, one handler can react to the 'Enter' key and the 
   other to the 'Exit' key. The order in which the handlers will process the events 
   corresponds to their Z-order. You can verify and modify this Z-order in the Embedded 
   Wizard Inspector. Please note, keyboard handlers created at the runtime with 
   the Chora 'new' operator will not work!
   The handler provides several variables with details of the received keyboard 
   event, like the key code (@Code or @CharCode), whether the user has pressed or 
   released the key (@Down), etc. These variables can be evaluated in the implementation 
   of the slot method.
   The property @Enabled can be used to activate/deactivate the keyboard handler. 
   Disabled handler will not react to the events. */
