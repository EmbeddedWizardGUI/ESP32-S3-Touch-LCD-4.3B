* DESCRIPTION:
*   This file implements the main.c module for running Embedded Wizard
*   generated GUI applications on a dedicated target with or without the usage
*   of an operating system.
*
*   Important: Please be aware that every Embedded Wizard GUI application
*   requires the execution in a single GUI task!
*   If you are working with an operating system and your software is using
*   several threads/tasks, please take care to access your GUI application
*   only within the context of your GUI thread/task. Use operating system
*   services to exchange data or events between the GUI thread/task and other
*   worker threads/tasks.
*
*   For more information concerning the integration of an Embedded Wizard
*   generated GUI application into your main application, please see
*   https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/main-loop
